# flask-experiments
A repository which contains all the flask experiments done to train with the module.

You will notice a huge amount of comments (not recommended in formal programming commentary). However, it is intended as a method to reinforce the knowledge acquired, as this has
been developed as a tutorial for me to learn flask.

The server is started by opening a terminal in the folder (Bash, PowerShell), and defining the following two variables:
  FLASK_APP="flaskr"
  FLASK_ENV="development"
  
The code can then be executed with "flask run through the Python console. If still using bash or PowerShell, use "python -m flask run" instead.
